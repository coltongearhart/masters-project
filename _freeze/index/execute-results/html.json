A key factor in choosing an appropriate sample size is the goal of the particular analysis. If explanation, as reflected by hypothesis tests of particular regression coefficients is the goal, there are many existing and different types of methods to help guide researchers with sample size calculations. However, if the goal of a study is prediction, then available methods are more limited. Through many different defined scenarios, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed to assess the predictive accuracy of multiple linear regression models that are trained on various sample sizes according to some previously proposed conventional rules. Scenarios were based on different combinations of the number of predictor variables and the degree of multicollinearity between them. Predictive accuracy was measured as the cross-validation root mean square error for predictions and also the squared simple correlation between predicted and observed responses for the holdout samples. Based off this simulation, a slight relationship was found between the sample size and predictive accuracy as measured by root mean square error. While results are general, systematically incorporating other aspects of a multiple linear regression analysis could provide more meaningful insights. Additionally, with the goal of precision in prediction, the subtle patterns do not provide enough evidence to give preference to any of the conventional sample size rules.\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: references.bib\nappendix-cite-as: display\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: flatly\n    code-block-border-left: \"#2C3E50\"\n    highlight-style: github\n    df-print: kable\nnumber-sections: true\ntitle-block-banner: true\nfig-cap-location: top\nfig-align: left\n---\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\neruptions <- c(1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021)\nn_eruptions <- length(eruptions)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#cell-fig-timeline .cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\npar(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1)\nplot(eruptions, rep(0, n_eruptions), \n  pch = \"|\", axes = FALSE)\naxis(1)\nbox()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma](index_files/figure-html/fig-timeline-1.png){#fig-timeline fig-alt='An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\navg_years_between_eruptions <- mean(diff(eruptions[-n_eruptions]))\navg_years_between_eruptions\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout .hidden}\n\n```\n[1] 79.83333\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every 79.8 years on average.\n\nStudies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).\n\nEight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).\n\nData and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.\n\nLet $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution\n\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n$$ {#eq-poisson}\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.\n\n| Name                 | Year   |\n| -------------------- | ------ |\n| Current              | 2021   |\n| Teneguía             | 1971   |\n| Nambroque            | 1949   |\n| El Charco            | 1712   |\n| Volcán San Antonio   | 1677   |\n| Volcán San Martin    | 1646   |\n| Tajuya near El Paso  | 1585   |\n| Montaña Quemada      | 1492   |\n\n: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}\n\n@tbl-history summarises the eruptions recorded since the colonization of the islands by Europeans in the late 1400s.\n\n![Map of La Palma](images/la-palma-map.png){#fig-map}\n\nLa Palma is one of the west most islands in the Volcanic Archipelago of the Canary Islands (@fig-map). \n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/explore-earthquakes.qmd#fig-spatial-plot >}}\n\n\n\n@fig-spatial-plot shows the location of recent Earthquakes on La Palma.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n:::{#refs}\n\n:::",
